# Mussel-Test1.1
This project is to calculate the heart rate and valve movement of mussel Mytilus galloprovoncialis using Arduino Mega.

The 1.0 version was used for the research project of "Real-time automated behavioural monitoring of mussels during contaminant exposures using an inproved microcontroller based device" The DOI will be provided after being published.

Update from Mussel-Monitor1.0:
Four IR sensors are working simultaneously each time, instead of one.
Now original IR signals are stored in 00.csv-07.csv, corresponding to A0-A7.
Now the IR and Hall results for each mussel are shown together.
